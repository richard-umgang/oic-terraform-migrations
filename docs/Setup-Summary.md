# OIC3 Terraform Migration - Setup Summary

## 🎉 What You've Accomplished

You've successfully set up JWT User Assertion authentication for OIC3! Here's what you have working:

### ✅ Authentication Configured

- **JWT Certificates Generated**: Private keys and certificates created for secure authentication
- **IDCS Applications Created**: Confidential applications configured with JWT grant type
- **Certificates Uploaded**: PKCS12 bundles uploaded to IDCS for JWT signing
- **Applications Assigned**: Apps assigned to OIC instances with ServiceAdministrator role
- **OAuth Flow Working**: JWT tokens can be generated and exchanged for access tokens

Your working authentication command:
```bash
# Generate JWT (username must have ServiceInvoker role in IDCS)
JWT_TOKEN=$(./scripts/generate-jwt.sh "$USERNAME" "$CLIENT_ID" "$PRIVATE_KEY_PATH" "$KEY_ALIAS")

# Exchange for access token
curl -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" | base64)" \
  -d "grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Ajwt-bearer&assertion=$JWT_TOKEN&scope=..." \
  "${IDCS_URL}/oauth2/v1/token"
```

**Key Parameters:**
- `USERNAME`: IDCS user with ServiceInvoker role (e.g., `john.doe@example.com`)
- `CLIENT_ID`: OAuth client ID from your confidential app
- `CLIENT_SECRET`: OAuth client secret
- `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`: Path to your private key PEM file
- `KEY_ALIAS`: Certificate alias from keytool (e.g., `oic-jwt-dev`)

## 🚀 What You Can Do Now

### 1. Discover Integrations

```bash
# List all integrations and connections in DEV
./scripts/list-integrations.sh dev
```

This generates:
- **HTML report** - Visual overview of all integrations
- **CSV file** - For analysis in Excel
- **Terraform template** - Ready to copy into your config

### 2. Export from DEV

```bash
# Export integrations (with connections) as .iar files
make export-dev
```

This will:
- Call OIC REST API to export integrations
- Store .iar files in Object Storage
- Create versioned exports with timestamps
- Maintain "latest" symlinks for easy imports

### 3. Import to TEST/PROD

```bash
# Import to TEST
make import-test

# Import to PROD (with confirmation)
make import-prod
```

This will:
- Download .iar file from Object Storage
- Import to target OIC instance
- Update connection properties for environment
- Test connections automatically
- Generate test report

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Current Setup

You're using JWT User Assertion which provides:

✅ **Certificate-based authentication** - More secure than passwords  
✅ **Short-lived tokens** - Access tokens expire after 1 hour  
✅ **No password storage** - JWT signed with private key  
✅ **Audit trail** - All API calls are logged  

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Store credentials in OCI Vault:**
   ```bash
   export OCI_VAULT_ID="ocid1.vault.oc1..."
   export OCI_KEY_ID="ocid1.key.oc1..."
   
   ./scripts/manage-credentials.sh store-oauth dev \
     "$CLIENT_ID" "$CLIENT_SECRET" "$USERNAME" "$PRIVATE_KEY_PATH"
   ```

2. **Rotate certificates annually:**
   - Generate new certificates
   - Upload to IDCS
   - Update Terraform configuration
   - Test before removing old certificates

3. **Limit access:**
   - Use GitLab protected branches
   - Require approvals for PROD
   - Enable MFA for OCI/IDCS access

## 📚 Next Steps

### 1. Configure Your First Integration

Edit `terraform/terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
integrations_to_migrate = [
  {
    id      = "YOUR_INTEGRATION|01.00.0000"  # From discovery
    code    = "YOUR_INTEGRATION"
    version = "01.00.0000"
    
    connections = {
      your_connection = {
        id = "CONNECTION_ID"  # From discovery
        
        test_properties = {
          "url" = {
            property_group = "CONNECTION_PROPS"
            property_name  = "connectionUrl"
            property_type  = "URL"
            property_value = "https://test-api.example.com"
          }
        }
        
        prod_properties = {
          "url" = {
            property_group = "CONNECTION_PROPS"
            property_name  = "connectionUrl"
            property_type  = "URL"
            property_value = "https://api.example.com"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## 🆘 Getting Help

### Quick Troubleshooting

**Authentication not working?**
```bash
# Test JWT authentication
./scripts/test-jwt-auth.sh dev

# Check certificate
openssl rsa -in ~/.oic-certs/dev/private-key.pem -check

# Verify IDCS app configuration
# - Certificate uploaded?
# - Client type = Trusted?
# - App assigned to OIC?
# - Correct scopes?
```

**Can't find integrations?**
```bash
# Run discovery
./scripts/list-integrations.sh dev

# Check the HTML report for integration IDs
```

**Import fails?**
```bash
# Check .iar file exists
oci os object list \
  --bucket-name oic-migration-artifacts \
  --prefix "integrations/dev/"

# Enable debug logging
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
make plan ENV=test
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You're ready to start migrating when you can:

- [ ] ✅ Generate JWT tokens successfully
- [ ] ✅ Exchange JWT for access tokens
- [ ] ✅ Call OIC REST APIs with access token
- [ ] ✅ List integrations using discovery script
- [ ] ✅ Export an integration from DEV
- [ ] ✅ Import to TEST with updated properties
- [ ] ✅ Test connections after import

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small:** Begin with one simple integration to verify your setup

2. **Use Discovery:** Run `list-integrations.sh` to see all integrations and generate Terraform templates

3. **Test First:** Always import to TEST before PROD

4. **Automate Testing:** Use `make test ENV=test` after every import

5. **Version Control:** Commit your terraform.tfvars to Git (without credentials!)

6. **Document Changes:** Keep notes on what was deployed and when

7. **Monitor:** Watch the first few executions after deployment closely

---

## 🎊 You're All Set!

You have a complete, production-ready solution for automating OIC migrations with JWT authentication.

**Your next command:**
```bash
make list-integrations ENV=dev
```

This will show you all available integrations and help you choose which ones to migrate first.

**Happy migrating! 🚀**
